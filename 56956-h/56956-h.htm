/></span>N a fateful day in 1914, without a warning flash or tremor, there fell
upon the world such a blast of war as human reason could not have
foreglimpsed, nor Apocalyptic vision raised, to appall the souls of men.
Twenty-seven nations took the shock and were rocked to their
foundations. Eleven were caught and knotted in the maddest agony of
conflict that ever was known. Through four years the winds of
destruction swirled and roared around the monstrous welter, before the
evil forces failed and their exhaustion brought a breathing space such
as lies at the heart of a typhoon. Around the widening edges of that
space they still muttered for a while in gusts of blood and fire, slowly
receding, slowly dying. But the great storm is gone; the long night that
seemed the night of doom is over.</p>

<p>Its epic has not been written. The time is too near us, the motive too
deep, the theme too vast. But out of the dark came many voices, voices
of lamentation, of home and love and hope and heroism and loftiest
ideality, of romance, of strange comedy. These had their inspiration
from a gigantic spectacle of elemental passions in cross-play, from the
thoughts and emotions not of a single people, but of all that were
fighting for the life and light of civilization. Poets great and poets
minor followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a>{6}</span> the war or fought in it, and expressed its spirit with a
personal, passionate fidelity impossible to historians.</p>

<p>It would not be well were all these voices lost. Many are worth fixation
where they may be heard again at will, and that is the reason for and
purpose of this book. The finest and truest of them are given here.</p>

<p>In making selection, availability for recitation has been considered.
There is no better way to stir the mind or fix the memory than by spoken
words of beauty in rhythmic cadence, especially in schools. It is hoped
they will be effective in such uses.</p>

<p>Readers will find in the captain notes many helpful sidelights upon
topics and personalities. These will commend themselves for their own
sake.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>From “The Anzac Book.” Cassell &amp; Co., Ltd., Publishers, London.

<p>This poem is one of many that were written to commemorate the
stubborn bravery of the Anzacs, the British soldiers from Australia
and New Zealand. These indomitables came half way round the globe
at Britain’s first call. Their first appearance was in Egypt, where
they drove the German-led Turks back into the desert and saved the
Suez canal. They were and are officially designated the “Australian
and New Zealand Army Corps,” a title too long for common use. They
have won fame and the world’s admiration as the “Anzacs,” a word
made by running together the first letters of their official title.
Australia’s own name for her soldier is Bill-Jim. “The Graves of
Gallipoli” is one of the most noble and tender poems that have come
to us out of the war.</p></div>

<span class="i0">In the little ivied steeple down in drowsy Bullington.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Small and sleepy, there it nestled, seeming far from hastening Time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a teeny-tiny village in some quaint old nursery rhyme;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a teeny-tiny river by a teeny-tiny weir<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sang a teeny-tiny ditty that I stayed a while to hear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_035" id="page_035"></a>{35}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh, the stream runs to the river, and the river to the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the reedy banks of Bullington are good enough for me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, the lane runs to the highway, and the highway o’er the down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it’s better here in Bullington than there in London town.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then high above an aeroplane in humming flight went by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the droning of its engines filling all the cloudless sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like the booming of a knell across that perfect day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came the gun’s dull thunder from the ranges far away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And while I lay and listened, oh, the river’s sleepy tune<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed to change its rippling music, like the cuckoo’s stave in June;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the cannon’s distant thunder, and the engines’ warlike drone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed to mingle with its burthen in a solemn undertone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh, the stream runs to the river, and the river to the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there’s war on land and water, and there’s work for you and me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on many a field of glory there are gallant lives laid down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well for tiny Bullington as mighty London town!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So I roused me from my daydream, for I knew the song spoke true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That it isn’t time for dreaming while there’s duty still to do;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I turned into the highway where it meets the flinty lane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the world of wars and sorrows was about me once again.<br /></span>

<p>Lieutenant Roche has deftly caught and preserved in words the
strange vision of unannounced trains that flashed now and then past
towns and villages bearing American troops from unknown camps to
unknown ports of embarkation&mdash;the flash of faces of men about whom
it was known only that they came from the shops and fields of home
and were going across the seas to fight somewhere, for those who
stood and gazed as they whirled by. The mystery, the roar of
wheels, the eddying dust and the silence that followed infuse these
lines with picture and sound that will stay in the minds of any who
saw such trains go hurrying away.</p></div>

<p>“Doughboy” is an old nickname for a United States infantryman. When
our army went into what is now New Mexico, Arizona and California
to quiet the Mexicans hostilities that preceded the war of 1846,
the infantry fell into a way of camping in houses built by the
natives with sun-dried bricks of adobé mud. The cavalry, having to
lie in the open with the horses, were joked thereat and came back
by calling the infantry dobie boys. The name stuck and by an easy
slide arrived at the present form.</p></div>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra2">I</span> WAS an exile from my own country and wandered over the breast of the
world seeking another country.</p>

<p>And I came into a land where there was only a long spring and a long
autumn, where they did not know the deadly heats of our summers or the
mortal colds of our mountains. Among the vines and sunny fields I saw
the people of this land at work, ever young of soul, smiling, loving,
and kindly.</p>

<p>I asked, “What is the name of this happy place?”</p>

<p>And the answer was, “France the voluptuous.”</p>

<p>I came to towns of splendid monuments, of harmonious buildings, of proud
triumphal arches of the past, and above always I saw the spires of great
cathedrals stretching toward the sky, as if to seize upon the feet of
God.</p>

<p>I asked, “What is the name of this marvelous land?”</p>

<p>And the answer was, “France the glorious.”</p>

<p>I advanced again, when I was struck by the red color of a large
river.... It was a river of warm blood that rolled down from afar in
thick and heavy waves. I advanced again. Before me dark clouds of smoke
hid the endless sky above huge fields of warriors in battle; when these
died smiling at death others took their places, singing.</p>

<p>I asked, “What is the name of this chivalrous land?”</p>

<p>And the answer was, “France the courageous.”</p>

<p>At last I came to an immense city, of which I saw neither the beginning
nor the end, a city full of sumptuous palaces, of parks, and fountains.
The sun glistened on the marble of the streets and kissed the serene,
resigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_094" id="page_094"></a>{94}</span> faces of women clothed in black. The chimes of churches filled
the air with solemn sounds, and words, until then unknown to me, “Te
Deum,” came from the throats of thousands of thousands.</p>

<p>With respect I asked, “What is the name of this land that mourns?”</p>

<p>And the answer was, “France the victorious.”</p>

<p>I kissed the earth of this land and said, “I have found my country, who
was an exile.”</p>

<p>More than all the others put together, the war poems of Alan Seeger,
Lieutenant Colonel McCrae, and Lieut. Rupert Brooke, have touched and
thrilled the heart of America. They are quiet, earnest, yet more
powerful than trumpet blasts, for they rise triumphant from great
depths, and as they sing, exalt.</p>

<p>Most familiar is our own Alan Seeger’s “I Have a Rendezvous with Death.”
He was studying in Paris when the war broke out. In the third week he
enlisted in the Foreign Legion. Two arduous years later he was called on
higher service. July 4, 1916, his squad was caught in an assault on the
village of Belloy-en-Santerre, where the Germans received them with the
fire of six machine guns. Seeger was severely wounded, but went forward
with the others, and helped take the place. Next morning he died. He had
kept the tryst.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alan Seeger was a New York boy. He was born in that city June 22, 1888.
In his short life he had written some twenty poems. This was his last.
It was written in camp, shortly before his call came:</p>

<p>Lieut. Col. John McCrae was a Canadian physician who served in the South
African war as an artilleryman. He was on his way to Canada when the war
began in 1914, and immediately upon landing he entered the Val Cartier
training camp and was commissioned a Captain. Later he joined the McGill
Hospital corps and went with it to France, where he rose to the rank of
Lieutenant Colonel, and died in service, January 28, 1918.</p>

<p>His poem, “In Flanders’ Fields,” was written on the Flanders front in
the Spring of 1915. Its inspiration is thus explained by Sergeant
Charles E. Bisset, of the 19th Battalion, 1st Brigade, Canadian
Infantry:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a>{101}</span></p>

<p>“On the Flanders front in the early Spring of 1915, when the war had
settled down to trench fighting, two of the most noticeable features of
the field were, first, the luxuriant growth of red poppies appearing
among the graves of the fallen soldiers, and second, that only one
species of bird&mdash;the larks&mdash;remained on the field during the fighting.
As soon as the cannonading ceased, they would rise in the air, singing.”</p>

<p>Rupert Brooke, a brilliant, impassioned young Englishman, was one of the
first to take arms when Great Britain went to war. He died in the
Dardanelles expedition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a>{102}</span> April 23, 1915. A few days before, he had sent
from the Ægean Sea to the English-speaking peoples the poem by which he
is best known:</p>

<p>Lieutenant Brooke was a rare poet, having a serene faith, a knowledge of
life as continuous. His bent of thought, the manner of his feeling,
shine most clearly in this sonnet:</p>

<p>All of Rupert Brooke’s work has been collected and issued, a rich though
slender sheaf. The book is fervently commended to people whose own souls
are in the key that responds to notes so spiritually fine and clear as

<p>“But a Short Time to Live” was written by Serg’t Leslie Coulson, whose
“little hour” came to an end at Arras, in France, October 7, 1916:</p>

<span class="i0">To dream our dreams, to sing our song,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To pick the fruit, to pluck the flower.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods&mdash;they do not give us long&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One little hour.<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">* * * * *</span><br />
<span class="i0">Our little hour&mdash;how soon it dies;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How short a time to tell our beads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a>{104}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To chant our feeble litanies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To think sweet thoughts, to do good deeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The altar lights grow pale and dim,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>These songs, with others that have lilted so bravely, so gravely,
through the world’s most bitter years of travail, will live long in
literature, with many more as strong or as sweet. Had all the writers
lived, we would have had a wealth of splendid gifts from them,
especially, maybe, from that “poor bird-hearted singer of a day,”
Francis Ledwidge, who fell in battle in Flanders, July 31, 1917.
Ledwidge was discovered by Lord Dunsany, himself a soldier-poet and a
patron of poets. He was lance corporal in Lord Dunsany’s company in the
5th Battalion of the Royal Inniskillen Fusileers. He wrote quite
touchingly to a friend shortly before the end, “I mean to do something
great if I am spared, but out here one may at any moment be hurled out
of life.” There is no doubt he would have done “something great,” for
here is a swan song not unworthy to bear his name to later times:</p>

<h2><a name="BLIGHTY_AND_GONE_WEST" id="BLIGHTY_AND_GONE_WEST"></a>“BLIGHTY” AND “GONE WEST”</h2>

<p>British soldiers in France have developed a terminology that is plain to
them, but confusing to civilians. They speak of “Blighty,” for example,
and of “Gone West.” These two terms express hopes&mdash;Blighty meaning home;
in common acceptance, home for rest and recuperation. “Gone West” means
gone from the east with its conflict to the refuge of death, where peace
waits in the glory of sunset.</p>

<p>“Blighty” is of Hindu origin. British officers in South Africa who had
served in India used the word, which is an Anglicized form of the Indian
word “vilayti,” meaning European. Englishmen being about the only
Europeans the natives knew, its application narrowed down to England
only; and the army fell into a way of using it as a synonym of home.
When the troops from India came into action early in the war, their
wounded were sent to the nearest English great hospital, at Brighton,
just across the channel. The consonance of Brighton and vilayti or
Blighty was so close that these men used their own word as a matter of
course, and in this way it floated into general use.</p>

<p>It has acquired a new sense of late. Casualties intermediate to those
too severe for removal and those that can be treated in field hospitals,
are sent to England&mdash;to Blighty&mdash;and are themselves called Blighty,
meaning wounds that get a man home. Lieut. Siegfried Sassoon has woven
the idea into a plaintively whimsical bit of verse which he calls</p>

<p>Hugh Pendexter, in Adventure Magazine, says “going west,” as used by the
men overseas to mean death, is of peculiarly American origin. The Karok
Indians of California believed the spirit of the good Karok went to the
“happy western land.” The Cherokee myths picture the west as the “ghost
country,” the twilight land where go the dead. The Shawnee tell of the
boy who “traveled west” to find his sister in the spirit land. The
Chippewa believes the spirit “followed a wide, beaten path toward the
west.” The spirit world of the Fox Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a>{123}</span> is at the setting of the
sun. And so on, in the theology of many Indian nations we find the West
as the storied abode of the great majority&mdash;who have passed over.</p>

<span class="ih">I was greeted at the training camp with joy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had hardly gotten settled, when a sergeant<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Told me I was now the Company’s errand boy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, I knew I’d have to start in at the bottom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And acquire my army training bit by bit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to be assigned to duties quite so humble,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was humiliating, surely you’ll admit.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My first errand was a trip to Field Headquarters.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It was raining and the mud was deep and thick.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was ordered to seek out the Major General,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And procure a requisition for a brick.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas explained to me, before I left my Company,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That our Captain suffered much with chilly feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that bricks, when rightly heated, would correct this.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What that Major General said, I’ll not repeat.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To our surly Regimental Quartermaster,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I was sent to get the Company’s Sunday hats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my Sergeant said, “to save myself some walking,”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I could “also get the First Lieutenant’s spats”;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I told that sour Quartermaster’s seageant<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What it was I’d like to have for Company A,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gosh, he “bawled me out,” said “Your ears should be longer,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And your rations should be changed from beans to hay.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For a thousand feet of skirmish line I hunted<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For a half a day, before I saw the joke;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_142" id="page_142"></a>{142}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next they sent me for a left-hand canvas stretcher,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To repair the Mess-hall windows, which were broke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the Company Street was slightly rough and bumpy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They dispatched me for a double-jointed plow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one breakfast-time they sent me to the Colonel,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a pail, to milk the Regimental cow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then one day the Sergeant said, “You’ve been promoted.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You’re now morning call-boy for the Regiment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each morning, bright and early, you will sprinkle<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Drops of water on each face, in every tent.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the morning I began my sprinkling duties,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And had sprinkled in about one dozen tents,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a bunch of fellows rushed me to the hydrant,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where they “soused” me good; since then I’ve had some sense.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As I look back at the time I “ran the paddles,”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">After having set me down in water wet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rushing down between two rows of husky messmates,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With my arms above my head, I feel it yet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, I’ve graduated from the rookie section,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the “awkward squad” will miss me in its ranks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I’m happy, for a bunch of bloomin’ rookies<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Have arrived. To those that sent them, Many Thanks.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A shot! Beside his victims ten the Uhlan Captain fell.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With bayonets through hands and feet they nailed the Zouave there,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Water! A single drop!” he moaned; but how they jeered at him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mocked him with an empty cup, and saw his sight grow dim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as in agony of death with blood his lips were wet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Prussian Major gaily laughed, and lit a cigarette.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">It was the little Jean Desprez who turned and stole aside;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And walked up to the dying man, and gave the drink to him.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A roar of rage! They seize the boy; they tear him fast away.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The dying dog he fain would save shall perish by his hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all his kindred they shall see, and all shall curse his name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who bought his life at such a cost, the price of death and shame.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They brought the boy, wild-eyed with fear; they made him understand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They stood him by the dying man, a rifle in his hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Make haste!” said they; “the time is short, and you must kill or die.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Major puffed his cigarette, amusement in his eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then the dying Zouave heard, and raised his weary head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Shoot, son, ’twill be the best for both; shoot swift and straight,” he said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Fire first and last, and do not flinch; for lost to hope am I;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will murmur: Vive la France! and bless you ere I die.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Half-blind with blows the boy stood there; he seemed to swoon and sway;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then in that moment woke the soul of little Jean Desprez.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And oh! the scents and sounds of spring, how sweet they were! how dear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He felt the scent of new-mown hay, a soft breeze fanned his brow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O God! the paths of peace and toil! How precious were they now!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The summer days and summer ways, how bright with hope and bliss!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The autumn such a dream of gold; and all must end in this:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This shining rifle in his hand, that shambles all around;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Zouave there with dying glare; the blood upon the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brutal faces round him ringed, the evil eyes aflame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Prussian bully standing by as if he watched a game.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Make haste and shoot,” the Major sneered; a minute more I give;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A minute more to kill your friend, if you yourself would live.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They only saw a barefoot boy, with blanched and twitching face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They did not see within his eyes the glory of his race;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glory of a million men who for fair France have died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The splendor of self-sacrifice that will not be denied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he was but a peasant lad, and oh! but life was sweet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Your minute’s nearly gone, my lad,” he heard a voice repeat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Shoot! Shoot!” the dying Zouave moaned; “Shoot! Shoot!” the soldier said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Jean Desprez reached out and shot ... <i>the Prussian Major dead</i>!<br /></span>

<h2>“HEARTS ARE TOUCHING”</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra2">P</span>OEMS need not be rhymed, nor wrought in verses. This brave and touching
one occurred in a letter written by a French schoolgirl:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It was only a little river; almost a brook; it was called the
Yser. One could talk from one side to the other without raising
one’s voice, and the birds could fly over it with one sweep of
their wings. And on the two banks there were millions of men, the
one toward the other, eye to eye. But the distance which separated
them was greater than the stars in the sky; it was the distance
which separates right from injustice.</p>

<p>“The ocean is so vast that the sea gulls do not dare to cross it.
During seven days and seven nights the great steamships of America,
going at full speed, drive through the deep waters before the
lighthouses of France come into view; but from one side to the
other, hearts are touching.”</p></div>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra2">I</span> STAND on a peak at Verdun&mdash;a scarred, torn peak of hope and death.</p>

<p>Far under my feet run the mystic passages of Fort Souville.</p>

<p>I strain my eyes to look over a great field where men have swayed in the
death lock with eternity.</p>

<p>Ahead and to the right and left stretch fifteen kilometres gaping with
wounds, each shell hole a pit of death, a hideous mark left by the
scourge of despotism.</p>

<p>Ahead is that foul stretch from which came and still come the hordes of
tyranny, with breath of poison and sting of contamination.</p>

<p>Behind is ruin. Never was such ruin. A blight, a torture, a world pain,
piercing and cruel.</p>

<p>And yet behind is hope. Behind are the legions of liberty, the soldiers
of our children’s freedom.</p>

<p>Behind are the endless legions, coming, coming, coming. Behind are the
veteran legions of France and Britain. Behind are the countless legions
of America, coming, coming, coming&mdash;a brown ribbon of promise stretching
across the sea to the shrine of Liberty!</p>

<p>Here where these jagged slashes in the yellow earth have formed a
glorious tomb for three hundred thousand gallant French&mdash;here is the
testing ground of our destiny. Here they have held for us our heritage!
Here they have perished in the eternal splendor of self-sacrifice for
us! Here is their borderland&mdash;and ours!</p>

<p>Here they have written with their ebbing blood the slogan that has
thrilled the world&mdash;“They shall not pass!”</p>

<p>The gaunt and sinister craters, one merging into the ragged rim of
another, the bits of shell, the battered helmets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_168" id="page_168"></a>{168}</span> broken guns,
ill-assorted refuse of combat&mdash;each shattered particle a marker for some
valiant soul “gone west” in service of humanity.</p>

<p>Here, over this land glorified by a nobility of deed than which there
has been no more exalted, must our war be waged. Out of this hallowed
ground comes the call of those who have given of their best&mdash;the call to
our great land for Old Glory’s best!</p>

<p>There will come to us wounds that will rack our bodies and drain the
coursing blood of our vibrant veins. There will come to us the aching
pain of suffering and loss&mdash;here on these red fields of France. But we
will save our souls and our nation’s soul! And we will save our heritage
and give to the billions of the world the right to theirs.</p>

<p>So the brown ribbon of youth winds across the sea&mdash;to Verdun and to the
long, thin lines on either side. Here will we prove our right to life
and liberty!</p>

<p>Brown ribbon of promise!</p>

<p>Hoping, longing, wounded France!</p>

<p>“Come&mdash;let’s pretend!” has been the slogan of all childhood. A few gay
feathers have transformed an everyday lad into a savage warrior; a
sweeping train has given a simple gingham frock the dignity of a court
robe; the power of make-believe has changed a bare attic into a gloomy
forest or perhaps into a royal palace. These six plays will appeal to
the imagination, to the fun-loving nature and to the best ideals of all
children.</p>

<p class="c"><span class="smcap">Contents.</span>&mdash;The Little Pink Lady (6 Girls); The Ever-Ever Land (16 Boys,
17 Girls); When the Toys Awake (15 Boys, 5 Girls); The Forest of Every
Day (5 Boys, 7 Girls); A Christmas Tree Joke (7 Boys, 7 Girls); “If
Don’t-Believe Is Changed Into Believe” (21 Boys, 15 Girls). Full
descriptions for producing; easy to costume and “put on.” Clever
illustrations showing the appearance of each character. The most
charming children’s plays ever written.</p>

<p>These selections are wholly original and sufficiently varied in
character and sentiment to enable the reader to make up a well-rounded
program in which high comedy mingles with farce and pathos in a manner
suitable for all occasions. Nineteen monologues and nine short poems
which are especially adapted to that particular form of entertainment
called the pianologue, viz., reading to music.</p>

<p>Some of the selections are new but most of them are the pick from the
author’s wide repertoire, which she has used throughout this country and
in England. They bear the stamp of enthusiastic public approval and are
now first offered to the public.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
